In response to the argument that peasant farmers and petty traders should not bear all the blame for increasing prices, it is important to consider The Price Control Act which provides guidelines for fair pricing and prevents exploitation of consumers. While it is understandable that individuals like yourself who engage in backyard farming are facing challenges due to increased costs, it is crucial to adhere to legal frameworks that promote fair pricing practices.

According to the Price Control Act, it is unlawful for sellers to engage in price gouging or unfair pricing practices that exploit consumers. By raising the prices of your vegetables solely to meet personal needs without considering the impacts on consumers, you may be in violation of these regulations. It is essential to strike a balance between meeting your needs and ensuring fairness in pricing to maintain integrity in the market.

As a valued member of the agricultural community, there are alternative solutions to consider, such as exploring government-supported programs, seeking financial assistance, or collaborating with other stakeholders to navigate the challenges posed by economic fluctuations. By collectively addressing these issues while upholding legal standards, a more sustainable and equitable marketplace can be achieved for all members involved.
